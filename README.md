# Medical Research Large Language Model (LLM)

<br>

## Overview:

### This project aims to build a Large Language Model (LLM) from scratch, specifically designed for processing and understanding medical research papers. Leveraging both PyTorch and TensorFlow, the model is built end-to-end based on state-of-the-art techniques and architectures described in recent medical NLP research.

The goal is to create a robust, domain-specific language model that can support advanced medical text mining, question answering, summarization, and knowledge extraction tasks.

Features
- Custom tokenizer and data preprocessing pipeline tailored for medical literature

- Transformer-based architecture implemented in PyTorch and TensorFlow

- Training on large-scale medical research datasets (e.g., PubMed, clinical trial reports)

- Fine-tuning capabilities for various downstream medical NLP tasks

- Modular design allowing easy experimentation with model components

- Detailed training logs and evaluation metrics to monitor progress

Motivation
Medical research literature contains complex, specialized language requiring models with domain-specific understanding. General LLMs often lack this focus, limiting their effectiveness in clinical and biomedical applications. This project bridges that gap by building a dedicated medical LLM, facilitating better AI-assisted medical research and clinical decision support.
