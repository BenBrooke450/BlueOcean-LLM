# Medical Research Large Language Model (LLM) from Scratch
## Overview
## This project aims to build a Large Language Model (LLM) from scratch, specifically designed for processing and understanding medical research papers. Leveraging both PyTorch and TensorFlow, the model is built end-to-end based on state-of-the-art techniques and architectures described in recent medical NLP research.

The goal is to create a robust, domain-specific language model that can support advanced medical text mining, question answering, summarization, and knowledge extraction tasks.

Features
Custom tokenizer and data preprocessing pipeline tailored for medical literature

Transformer-based architecture implemented in PyTorch and TensorFlow

Training on large-scale medical research datasets (e.g., PubMed, clinical trial reports)

Fine-tuning capabilities for various downstream medical NLP tasks

Modular design allowing easy experimentation with model components

Detailed training logs and evaluation metrics to monitor progress

Motivation
Medical research literature contains complex, specialized language requiring models with domain-specific understanding. General LLMs often lack this focus, limiting their effectiveness in clinical and biomedical applications. This project bridges that gap by building a dedicated medical LLM, facilitating better AI-assisted medical research and clinical decision support.
